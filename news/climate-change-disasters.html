      <p>
        Climate change is accelerating the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worldwide. Heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and powerful storms are becoming more severe as global temperatures continue to rise. The last three years have been the hottest on record since the pre‑industrial era, underscoring the ongoing impact of fossil fuel emissions and the rapid warming of the planet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this escalation, the relationship between climate‑driven hazards and human mortality is not straightforward. Global data shows that while extreme weather events are becoming more intense, overall deaths from these disasters have declined over recent decades. This trend reflects improvements in early warning systems, emergency preparedness, and infrastructure resilience — but it does not mean the risks are diminishing.
      </p>

      <h2>Heatwaves: The Rising “Silent Killer”</h2>

      <p>
        Heat remains one of the most underestimated climate threats. Unlike storms or floods, heatwaves often cause delayed or indirect fatalities, particularly among older adults and people with pre‑existing health conditions. Scientific assessments show that extreme heat is becoming deadlier, with more regions experiencing prolonged periods of dangerous “feels‑like” temperatures above 32°C.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recent global estimates indicate tens of thousands of heat‑related deaths annually, and broader health analyses suggest the true toll is significantly higher due to underreporting and delayed attribution. As climate change intensifies, heatwaves are emerging as one of the most lethal climate‑driven hazards.
      </p>

      <h2>Floods and Storms: Fewer Deaths, Higher Exposure</h2>

      <p>
        While floods and tropical storms remain capable of causing large‑scale devastation, mortality from these events has decreased in many regions. Investments in early warning systems, improved building standards, and disaster‑response capacity have saved countless lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the underlying risk remains high. A single catastrophic event can dramatically shift annual statistics, and densely populated, low‑income regions continue to face disproportionate vulnerability. The gap between exposure and resilience is widening, especially where infrastructure and emergency systems are limited.
      </p>

      <h2>A Global Trend Without a Simple Pattern</h2>

      <p>
        Year‑to‑year disaster mortality varies widely. Some years see sharp increases due to isolated high‑impact events such as major earthquakes or severe storms. Other years show declines due to improved preparedness and fewer large‑scale disasters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long‑term data reveals no consistent downward or upward trend in total disaster deaths — but it does show a clear rise in the frequency and intensity of climate‑related hazards. As events occur more often and with less recovery time between them, the strain on communities and systems grows.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge Ahead</h2>

      <p>
        Humanity has made significant progress in reducing disaster mortality through better forecasting, communication, and infrastructure. But as climate change accelerates, these gains face increasing pressure. More intense heatwaves, stronger storms, and more frequent floods will continue to test the limits of global resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        GFIA emphasizes that while improved preparedness has saved lives, long‑term safety depends on addressing the root causes of climate change, strengthening global adaptation strategies, and ensuring that vulnerable communities receive the support and resources they need.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world is entering an era where climate‑driven hazards are unavoidable — but preventable deaths are not. Continued investment in resilience, education, and verified climate knowledge remains essential for protecting communities and shaping a sustainable future.
